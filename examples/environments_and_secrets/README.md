# GitHub repository with environments and secrets

This deploys the module and has a starter for exercising environments & secrets.  TODO more coverage required.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = "~> 1.9"
  required_providers {
    github = {
      source  = "integrations/github"
      version = "~> 6.5.0"
    }
    modtm = {
      source  = "azure/modtm"
      version = "~> 0.3"
    }
    random = {
      source  = "hashicorp/random"
      version = "~> 3.5"
    }
  }
}

resource "random_pet" "repo_name" {
  length = 2
}

data "github_user" "current" {
  username = "kewalaka"
}

# This is the module call
# Do not specify location here due to the randomization above.
# Leaving location as `null` will cause the module to use the resource group location
# with a data source.
module "github_repository" {
  source = "../../"
