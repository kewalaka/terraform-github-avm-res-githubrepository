# Terraform GitHub Repository module in the style of AVM

This is a module for creating GitHub repository and supporting child resources written in the style of Azure Verified Modules.

This has been submitted to the AVM team for consideration and should be considered unofficial.

The intention is to separately develop another module for GitHub Organizations and related components (terraform-github-avm-githuborganization).

## Features

- Create and manage GitHub repositories, branches & environments
- Apply classic branches protection
- Manage variables & secrets at the repository and environment scope.
- Enable or disable features such as issues, discussions, wiki, etc.

TODO:

- Rulesets
- Testing for adding team permissions
- Testing for adding files & using templates
- OIDC subject mapping
- Associating runner groups and apps
- Managing collaborators

.. probably more I haven't thought of yet!

## Testing locally

To test locally:

- set `GITHUB_OWNER` to your Github organisation or individual user account.
- install the GitHub CLI
- log in use `gh auth`
- fetch the token using `gh auth status -t`
- set `GITHUB_TOKEN` to the token value returned by the previous command.
